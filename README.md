# PID
Proportional-Derivative-Integral controller for laser stabilization at HU Berlin.

Successful laser locking with this PID. Coefficients used for locking : Kp = 0.2, Ki = 0.2, Kd = 0.0.
10 dB attenuator used just after DAC.
Laser currnent controller used in locking experiment: the one above, HU rev 7.2017
